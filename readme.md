## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kian,

I'm an enthusiastic individual with a strong foundation in computer science, particularly in cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Well-versed in networks, Linux, and programming algorithms, seeking further study and mentorship to enhance skills. Proficient in Python and familiar with web development languages, demonstrating a commitment to ongoing learning and professional growth.<br>
As a person with a teamwork character, I have always worked side by side with a team in all projects that I have participated in.<br>
I enjoy new experiences and challenges. In other words, I prefer to follow new challenges instead of routine works. The quote "The only way to do great work is to love what you do" has been always my motto.<br>
By the way, reputation for hard-working, creativity, problem solving and team working are the highlights of my character.
